### Java Architecture

JDK (Java Development Kit) – Tools + Compiler + JRE (for development).

JRE (Java Runtime Environment) – JVM + libraries (to run Java apps).

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) – Executes bytecode into machine code.

### Windows Installation Steps

# Step 1: Download JDK

Visit Oracle JDK Downloads

Download JDK 25 for Windows x64

Run the installer

# Step 2: Set Environment Variables

Right-click This PC → Properties → Advanced system settings

Click Environment Variables

Under System variables:

Create JAVA_HOME = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-25\bin

Edit Path → Add %JAVA_HOME%\bin

# Step 3:Verify Installation
